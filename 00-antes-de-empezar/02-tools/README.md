Here some tools that we will use to communicate and record our
progress throughout this process:

# [Slack](aceleracion-oea.slack.com): Collective communication and learning tool:

Slack is an asynchronous communication tool to share our learnings and doubts as a group. In fact, it is very similar to whatsapp but it is designed to simplify collaboration and teamwork. To start the program you must join the space designed for this program in slack [Here](https://join.slack.com/t/aceleracion-oea/shared_invite/zt-iui04vkn-NyHdalUdDLGMinaGNrEyjw) and introduce yourself to the community.

- Once you join the slack group go to the channel "community-bonding"
- Post a photo of yourself with a description so that the rest of the participants can know you better. Bonus: Share with the rest by answering the following question: How have you tried to reduce corruption in your community?
- Do not forget to personalize your profile and upload your photo, name, contact information and current occupation.  

Still curious about how Slack works?

# [Zoom](https://zoom.us/): Video calls

This will be the platform for all our remote sessions: The session with all
the group as well as the mentoring spaces with each of the initiatives. In the remote group sessions we will use the break out rooms functionality to divide the participants according to each initiative.

Our link for remote and mentoring sessions will always be: https://laboratoria-la.zoom.us/j/97931354629

# [Experimentation section - Aprende](https://aprende.laboratoria.la/cohorts/glob-2020-11-l4b-business-aceleracion-fase-2-oea/experiments/):Documentation and registration of progress in your initiatives and experiments.

You already used this section of the platform in the first phase of the program where you shaped the first version of your initiative. This is the same tool that will accompany you throughout the process to shape your experiments and register your learnings.
