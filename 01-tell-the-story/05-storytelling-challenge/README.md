# Challenge: Apply what you have learned

* Tipo: `lectura`
* Formato: `self-paced`
* Duraci√≥n: `5min`

***
Now is time to apply what you have learned and do a first _warm up_ telling us
your story. Use the tools, build it, and tell it by recording a [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) and sending it to us by ***slack***. Remember it should last from **5-8 minutes**
maximum.

This warm up will allow you to have feedback quickly so you can keep improving
your pitch.
